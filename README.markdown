Nickel Cinema
=============

Nickel Cinema presents users with the latest movie releases, along with their Netflix suggested ratings, trailers, and local show-times.

Functionality
-------------

### Web interface

1. User logs in (i.e. get her Netflix account info)
2. We get a list of new movie releases, get netflix scores, find trailers and local showtimes.
3. We present the filtered/sorted list of results to the user

### RSS Feed

* We already know the user and have built a custom RSS feed for her
* We fill the feed with the above information

Getting Content
---------------

### New Releases

TBD.  We need to get the latest releases from somewhere.  This list is filtered/sorted according to netflix ratings.

### Netflix Ratings

We pull the ratings for each movie from Netflix since they do a great job of it!

### Trailers

TBD.  We need to get links to trailers for the movies.

### Show Times

TBD.  We need to get local show-times for the movies somehow.  Probably this will be a combination of ip-location and scraping from some service (or using Google AJAX search API?)
