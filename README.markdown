Nickel Cinema
=============

Nickel Cinema presents users with the latest movie releases, along with their Netflix suggested ratings, trailers, and local show-times.

Functionality
-------------

TBD.

New Releases
------------

TBD.  We need to get the latest releases from somewhere.  This list is filtered/sorted according to netflix ratings.

Netflix Ratings
---------------

We pull the ratings for each movie from Netflix since they do a great job of it!

Trailers
--------

TBD.  We need to get links to trailers for the movies.

Show Times
----------

TBD.  We need to get local show-times for the movies somehow.  Probably this will be a combination of ip-location and scraping from some service (or using Google AJAX search API?)
